Bethan Botha – QA Portfolio

Welcome to my Manual QA Testing portfolio.

I am a QA-focused professional with a background in Languages and Mathematics, experienced in structured testing, usability review, and documentation. I focus on identifying issues before users do and communicating them clearly for fast resolution.

 My QA Approach

My testing process starts from the user journey. I validate happy paths first, then explore edge cases such as:

- Incorrect input
- Navigation issues
- Permissions
- Data validation
- Usability gaps
- Regression after fixes

I aim to provide clear, reproducible bug reports and maintain simple, organized test documentation that supports engineering teams.
